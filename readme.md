## Laravel JWT (JSON Web Token) Scaffold with roles and permissions empowered by **Entrust** 

## Description
Just a basic scaffold implementing aftermentioned packages

* JWT-Auth - [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
* Entrust - [zizaco/entrust](https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust)

I used a HACK that I found in a forum to exploit entrusts role and permission supprot for session based auth system to work with JWT auth tokens which is totally stateless.

Checkout TokenEntrustAbility route-middleware to get the hang of it ;)

## Feedback
